# Design Document for Initial Pitch
This document outlines a few thoughts Daniel has had towards Velcrelephant, and his ideas on design, scope, and implementation. This document is expected to change.

## Elevator
Since Rita's figuring out some plot ideas, Daniel's putting the minimum in for outlining. He'll refine this after Tuesday.

Oh no! `antagonist` has taken the `n‚ààùõß; 3 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 5` magic `things` and `hid them at the end of the levels`. Help Velcrelephant and Hooky Hippo `save the day by getting to the end of the levels`. Walk, run, jump, and stick to whatever you can to `save day woo yay idk`!

## Attitudes and Audience
Velcrelephant will be a game that's cute. It should be enjoyable and relatable for a wide audience, but the hope of our game is for it to appeal to children.

Velcrelephant should not be a difficult game, but at the same time not be a game that disrespects the player's effort. While the player may need to think to solve a puzzle or concentrate to defeat a baddie, it should not be taxing. Our work will be acceptable if we do not bore the player, good if we do not stress the player, and ideal if we help the player relax.

Velcrelephant can be played by yourself, or cooperatively with another person. The content in the game should be suited for single player mode, but designed in a way that two players can go about the challenges together. Solving puzzles or fighting baddies should not feel like two people doing activities for one person. A child should be able to enjoy exploring Velcrelephant on their own, but also be able to have that experience with a friend, parent, or sibling.

## Gameplay
This section will cover gameplay for Velcrelephant.
### Overview
Velcrelephant is a tile-based platforming game. Tiles in this game will be explicit, and convey a consistent, blocky, form. Some examples of this style include [Alex Kidd in Miracle World](http://youtu.be/Rb9haoWT5js?t=19m34s), [Mr. Gimmick](http://youtu.be/zYcf2yUgblc?t=1m28s), and [Kirby's Adventure](http://youtu.be/rJXM4EPbPe0?t=3m19s).
