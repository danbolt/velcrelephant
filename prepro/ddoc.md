# Design Document for Initial Pitch
This document outlines a few thoughts Daniel has had towards Velcrelephant, and his ideas on design, scope, and implementation. This document is expected to change.

## Elevator
Since Rita's figuring out some plot ideas, Daniel's putting the minimum in for outlining. He'll refine this after Tuesday.

Oh no! `antagonist` has taken the `n‚ààùõß; 3 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 5` magic `things` and `hid them at the end of the levels`. Help Velcrelephant and Hooky Hippo `save the day by getting to the end of the levels`. Walk, run, jump, and stick to whatever you can to `save day woo yay idk`!

## Attitudes and Audience
Velcrelephant will be a game that's cute. It should be enjoyable and relatable for a wide audience, but the hope of our game is for it to appeal to children.

Velcrelephant should not be a difficult game, but at the same time not be a game that disrespects the player's effort. While the player may need to think to solve a puzzle or concentrate to defeat a baddie, it should not be taxing. Our work will be acceptable if we do not bore the player, good if we do not stress the player, and ideal if we help the player relax.

Velcrelephant can be played by yourself, or cooperatively with another person. The content in the game should be suited for single player mode, but designed in a way that two players can go about the challenges together. Solving puzzles or fighting baddies should not feel like two people doing activities for one person. A child should be able to enjoy exploring Velcrelephant on their own, but also be able to have that experience with a friend, parent, or sibling.

## Gameplay
This section will cover gameplay for Velcrelephant.
### Overview
Velcrelephant is a tile-based platforming game. Tiles in this game will be explicit, and convey a consistent, blocky, form. Some examples of this style include [Alex Kidd in Miracle World](http://youtu.be/Rb9haoWT5js?t=19m34s), [Mr. Gimmick](http://youtu.be/zYcf2yUgblc?t=1m28s), and [Kirby's Adventure](http://youtu.be/rJXM4EPbPe0?t=3m19s). Games from the early [Kirby franchise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby_(series) will serve as a chief guide for atmospheric style.

The objective while playing Velcrelephant will be to get to the end of the level. The player will directly control Velcrelephant with they keyboard or gamepad. They will have to run, jump over obstacles, and stick to objects using their velcro-based powers. The player will also have to avoid or defeat baddies that appear onscreen.

The player will have a "life bar", represented onscreen as hearts or some sort of container. Upon contact with a baddie the Player player will lose some quantity of life. If the player runs out of life, they will have to restart the level. The player will likely need to take five or six hits.
### Moveset
#### Summary
The moveset for Velcrelephant will require directional input (either digital or analog) and two digital button inputs. The directional input will allow the player to walk left and right. The first button will allow the player to jump, while the second button will allow the player to activate their velcro powers.
#### Hitbox
The player's hitbox will be a 1x1 tile, with actual size likely one or two pixels smaller. This is to make gameplay feel fair and allow the player to fit easily in 1 tile-high tunnels.
#### Movement
Moving the directional input left or right will horizontally move Velcrelephant. Acceleration/deacceleration will be instantaneous, as seen in Kirby's Adventure or [Solomon's Key](http://youtu.be/dsjDrsqlMKE?t=7m25s). This horizontal motion is the same if Velcrelephant is in midair (eg: jumping or falling).
#### Jumping
If the player presses the first input button, Velcrelephant will jump when on the ground. Jumping will make Velcrelephant move in a vertical arc, rising 1-2 tiles high before falling. The vertical motion should be parabolic, akin to gravity seen in other platformers.

Pressing and holding the jump button for longer/shorter periods of time should not affect jumping time. Or, jumping should be seen as a one-off action.
#### Velcro Powers
Pressing the second input button will activate/deactivate Velcrelephant's Velcro Powers. This could either be a toggle or "hold" technique (or both, determined by a player setting). This can only be done when Velcrelephant is resting on the ground. If Velcrelephant is walking when they activates their Velcro Powers, Velcrelephant will stop walking, and the player will need to release and press left/right once again to continue walking.

`diagram?`

Upon activating Velco powers, things will stick to Velcrelephant! The only things that will stick to Velcrelephant are specific **living objects**, which will be defined later. Sticking means any living objects that are touching Velcrelephant's hitbox will be attached, and act as though they are part of the same body. Velcrelephant cannot stick to living objects that are enemies or things like powerups, coins, items, etc.

`diagram`

If Velcrelephant is touching the ground, jumping, or falling, pressing left and right will move the attached objects along with Velcrelephant. Velcrelephant can jump off the ground while attached. If Velcrelephant is suspended, or attached to an object below, then moving left, right, or jumping will not do anything. This may require addressing specific edge cases when implementing.

Velcrelephant can still receive damage when attached to objects. If Velcrelephant is attacked or damaged while stuck to something, the Velcro Powers will deactivate.

#### Receivng Damage

### Environments
#### Scrolling
Environments will be levels commonly seen in platform video games, using the mentioned blocky tile style. As Velcrelephant moves across the level, the game's camera will scroll, keeping Velcrelephant in the inner 50% (subject to change) of the screen. The screen will only scroll in one direction at a time, as seen in games like [Mega Man 2](YOUTUBE) and Alex Kidd in Miracle World.

`object type diagram`

#### Object Types
Things in the environments can be dividied into three varieties, Background Objects, Static Objects, and Living Objects. Each will have a specific role, purpose, and visual style.
##### Background Objects
Background Objects make up things that the player cannot interact with, or don't interfere with the game logic. These are typically aesthetic things that contribute to the taste and texture of the world. Velcrelephant cannot interact with these things, and they shouldn't attempt to take the player's attention. Living Objects can pass over these as though they are not there.
##### Still Objects
Still Objects can be thought of as "static tiles" or the game's foreground. This will generally be tiles that make up the floor, walls, and platforms. They do not move, and have non-distracting animations, if any at all. Living Objects should not be occupy the same space as background objects.
##### Living Objects
Living Objects can be seen as the "game entities" of the world. They move, animate, and can be seen like actors on a stage. Living Objects may or may not overlap with one another. Examples include Velcrelepaht, Hooky Hippo, moving platforms, baddies, blocks, dropped items, etc.

### Playing Cooperatively
A second player can play as Hooky Hippo, who can accompany Velcrelephant along on the adventure. Hooky Hippo has an identical moveset to Velcrelephant, but is represented by a different set of sprites.

Camera movement and two-player game logic will follow *Sakurai rules*, implying that it will only follow Velcrelephant, and never Hooky Hippo. If Hooky Hippo is left behind off the screen by Velcrelephant's movement, Hooky Hippo will be brought to Velcrelephant's location near-instantaneously, with an animation that indicating that Hooky Hippo has moved. Examples of this can be seen in [Kirby's Super Star](YOUTUBE) and [Super Smash Bros. Brawl](YOUTUBE).

If one player perishes, then the other can keep playing until the end of the level (or reaches some sort of checkpoint). After, both players can resume playing again.

WebRTC syncronization of game entities is a stretch goal, and serializing game data should be considered in the implementation to support this.

## Content Scope
The game's content will consist of a specific number of levels, and these levels should be organized in order to encourage a specific duration of play time. The following section will suggest a few specific sets:
### Level Scope
- **Mushroom Kingdom**: Organize the levels into *worlds*, each containing a set of levels that follow a common theme. These sorts of worlds are typically numbered, such as the first level of the first world would be 1-1, or the second level of the fourth world being 4-2. This is a good way of showing the player's progress, and allows the world to be seen as like a score counter. The levels can follow a difficulty curve, introducing and elaborating on gameplay elements from the first to last level of a world. Levels are generally quite short, can be completed in a minute or two, and a small play session would be finishing all the levels in the world. The last world would typically have some sort of boss character to fight. A cornerstone example of this would be [Super Mario Bros](YOUTUBE).
- **Dream Land**
Each level has a specific theme or style to it, and are generally a bit longer. Levels can be organized into certain *areas*, allowing the designer to give a sense of pacing and flow. A small play session would typically be one level, lasting around ten minutes or so. Each level would have a boss at the end of it. An example of this would typically be games in the Kirby series.
- **Dinosaur Island**
Each level is part of a network, where players can navigate between on an overworld map. Upon completing one level, players would be able to play new ones, and slowly explore the game world. Levels would typically be around three or four minutes, and secret exits can show connections to new levels. Levels with boss characters would appear usually after a specific set of levels. [Super Mario World](YOUTUBE) is a good example of this.

## Visual Style
The game will have a bright, comfortable, cartoony style. Players or viewers should find it very easy to differentiate living, still, and background objects from one another.
### Colour and Texture
```diagram showing colours/textures```
#### Living Objects
Living objects should use bright colours, light patterns/textures, and distinct outlines. Animations and interactions with Still and other Living Objects should also activate particle effects, where suitable. Living Objects should attempt to grab the most attention from the player, and be considered to have the most positive space.
#### Still Objects
Still Objects should use darker, more subdued colours, consistent patterns/textures, and subtle outlines. They should be visible and apparent to the player, but only give enough attention to help the player know what they are. Detail is good in Still Objects, but they should not distract from the Living Objects interacting.
#### Background Objects
Background Objects are entirely cosmetic, and will likely stimulate the player through their peripheral vision. Background objects should stick to more faded pastels, and never try to grab the player's attention. If the player pays attention to a background object, its because they have voluntarily done so, or rather, they have *stopped to appreciate the view and smell the flowers*.
### Cutscenes
```TODO```
Lots of cool things we can do here! Maybe a slide show and some text? Those are always nice.
### Depictions of Violence
The game will depict violent behaviour between Velcrelephant and baddies, but it will be suitable for general audiences, and not particularly realistic. The following should be pretty clear cut.

Upon a baddie being "killed" or "defeated", it will have a "death" animation similar to a puff of smoke or KO. Examples of this can be seen in [Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening](YOUTUBE), [LOST YETI](YOUTUBE), or [Donkey Kong Country](YOUTUBE).

The game will not show any depictions of blood or gore.

Cutscenes will not show depictions of violence.

Characters resembling humans will not be seen in depcitions of violence.

Protagonists that the player can control, such as Velcrelephant or Hooky Hippo, should avoid depicting violence in a cruel manner.

If Velcrelephant were to be rated by the ESRB, it should obtain a rating of *E for Everyone*.

## Audio
`TODO: sound effects, bgm, etc.`

## Text
The game should employ text where necessary, but rely on it as little as possible. **A player should never need to understand English to play Velcrelephant.**

Cutscenes can show dialogue, but it should be short and use simple English. A young child should be able to enjoy the game.

Text used in user interfaces should use few words, and try to rely on simple verbs to describe things where possible. Particle effects may use onomatopeia (such as a bomb going *boom*), but these words should be as short as possible and easy to read.

`figure: locatization tables`

All dialogue, interface, and other gameplay-related text should be stored in a dictionary that's labelled indexed by descriptive names. For example, if the programmer wanted to draw 'TOASTER' on a menu option, it should be stored with a key `menu_toaster` that should map to the string. If necessary, this dictionary can be relocalized without having to change game code. For example, 'menu_toaster' could map to '„Éà„Ç¢„Çπ„Çø' in Japanese.
