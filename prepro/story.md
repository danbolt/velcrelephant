# Story Ideas

## Introduction
Velcrelephant is the story of a Velcrelephant doll owned by a little girl, Angel. Velcrelephant must rescue the Magic Council, who are Five (?) Painted Pet Rocks. Perhaps Kirby-like gameplay, but with the aesthetic of a 2D littlebigplanet?

## Characters

Velcrelephant: bravest little elephant there is. Very headstrong and stubborn. Charges into fights without thinking about them. Learns very quickly. Think "Korra".

Bottom of feet, nose, top of head and back are all Velcro hooks. Transformation ideas:  tissues -> ghost velcrelephant. Cotton balls -> cloud velcrelephant. 

Angel is good at arts and crafts so she can eventually make real costumes as well: Wizard velcrelephant? Knight velcrelephant?

Hooky Hippo: Velcrelephant's best friend. A bit bumbling, but very protective of her friends and fearsome when they are in danger. Think "Pooh bear" personality.

Zippanda: Assist character. A backpack really, able to deliver items at handy opportunities.

Magic Council: Angel's former favourite toys, now captives. Hand painted pet rocks. Each is hidden in a different part of the house. Wise and ancient, generally, think LOTR wizards. First is doddering and weird-- think Radagast. Offers Velcrelephant advice once rescued.

## Humans

Angel: A smart little girl. Called "Little one" or "Little Angel" by her Mom, "Dweeb" by her brother. A bit of a loner, doesn't have many friends. Watched a lot of TV growing up since Mary was busy. Very active imagination, and likes arts and crafts. Adept with popsicle sticks and pipe cleaners.

Joseph: Angel's twin brother. Evil in the way that siblings are evil-- not really, but seems that way sometimes. Loves basketball, hanging out with friends. Really wants to be cool. Wants to be called Joe, because that's cooler. Angel refuses.

Mary: Angel and Joseph's overworked single mom. Sad that she can't afford more for her twins, and that she can't spend more time with them.

Michelle: Angel's best and really only friend. Owns  Hooky Hippo. Not as imaginative as Angel and has other friends, but tries her best to play along.

## Storyline

Prologue: It's the twins' birthday, and Mom has given Angel Velcrelephant, her new best friend. Joe gets a new basketball, to his delight-- he'll be so much cooler now. Mom expresses regret that she couldn't get Angel any of the Velcrelephant accessories-- Fairy costume and Princess costume-- but Angel doesn't mind. Velcrelephant ain't not Princess or Fairy. She's off to have adventures.

Act 1: To start her adventure, Velcrelephant seeks the Magic Council, who are somewhere in Angel's room. Once she reaches there, the council is stolen by Joseph, who mocks Angel for playing with rocks. He hides them around the house. Velcrelephant has found the adventure she is looking for: rescue the council.

Acts 2-5: Rescue a council member in a different room of the house. Ideas:

- Living room? Messy.
- Hallway?
- Attic? Dusty, dangerous.
- Bathroom?? Slippery!!
- Outdoors... Bee velcrelephant?
- Kitchen. Lava!!

Act 6: Final challenge, rescue Gandalf rock. This is in Joe's room. Creepy, think Sid in Toy Story (but maybe not that creepy.)
