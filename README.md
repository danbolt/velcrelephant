## About!
A platforming game for one or two!

## Design and Documentation
Daniel's working on it. More on that later.

## Building!
This project uses the awesome [Phaser](http://phaser.io) game programming library, and a helpful [yeoman package](https://github.com/rcolinray/generator-phaser-typescript). Daniel was able to make Galaga-style gameplay in an afternoon with it.

To build it you'll need to clone and install the dependencies. It's super easy! After you've cloned this repo just go:
```
npm install
bower install
```
You might need certain `sudo` privileges to get everything running.

Once you're all installed, simply type the following:
```
gulp
```

And there you go! Your web browser should open and start flinging static files at your face. Gulp should rebuild things as you need.
